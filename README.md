# Buried PokeRed
A fork of https://github.com/pret/pokered that hides a dark secret in Lavender Town...

## Finding Buried Alive
1. Get the Poke Doll from the Celadon Department Store
2. Just simply use it when fighting against the Ghost of Marowak inside the Pokemon Tower
3. Go up the stairs and interact with the right Grave Stone (Hint: Make sure to backup your save file.)
